# Autofisher
External application that holds the right click mouse button for autofishing stations in Minecraft. 
Minimal performance impact, and since it's external you don't need a custom minecraft client, it runs outside of minecraft.

In Minecraft, it's possible to create an autofishing station using iron trapdoors and noteblocks, but in order to afk the user needs to place something heavy on the right mouse button to keep it depressed. This application removes the need to manually hold the mouse button down and does it through software.
